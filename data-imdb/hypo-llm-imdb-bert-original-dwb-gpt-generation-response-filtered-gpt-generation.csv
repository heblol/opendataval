Tarantino tries to be edgy and controversial but it just feels forced and unoriginal. We're supposed to be interested in seeing a bunch of hateful characters stuck in a cabin and just talking for hours on end. Tarantino got old or just lost interest or just isn't making great movies anymore. Even his classic dialogue bits have lost all their wit and charm. You can say that about Hollywood in general though because how many years have they been remaking the same kinds of useless movies?",0

"The main character in the movie ([[se's]] suicidal) decides to take a trip to Europe to clear his head. He meets a woman at a cafe - as has the friend he takes - so both know how to order coffee in French; but, instead of ordering the drink thousands of people order every day around the world (a latte), they order [[octopus]]. We also are to believe that although the man is in love with his girlfriend, he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to a long-distance relationship. Further, even though this is a vacation, the first time he's with his new friend, he tells her all his deepest secrets, as if they've known each other for years.

"The acting in The Lion King is more <<amazin>> than amazing in this animated classic that <<suceeds>> from the outset to captivate the audience. The voiceover of James Earl Jones poses a roadblock almost immediately for the highly emotive Donald Glover and it's <<good>> chemistry from the outset. Simba (Glover) runs away from his kingdom after his father's death and is forced to face his demons and return to claim his rightful place as king. As Simba becomes more mature, he delves further into the truth about his past and discovers his destiny. The Lion King resembles a few Disney classics, but Jon Favreau rapidly establishes he is no master of animation. Glover is no Mufasa and he is a hard sell for a character more suited to the regal styles of Jeremy Irons or James Earl Jones. Favreau never really succeeds in getting Glover to defer in desperate fashion to Jones' commanding voice. His attempts come across as a young prince while Jones' deep voice takes on majestic authority. Beyonce completes the miscasting as Nala. Talk about piling on. The stunning visuals provide some highly realistic animal animations, but Favreau and cast utilize the computer-generated graphics meekly and the tension remains tepid. With Favreau far from his forte (live-action) and the voiceovers not fitting their characters, The Lion King <<drowns>> all involved.",0
